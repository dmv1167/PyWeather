# Python Weather GUI

This application utilizes the OpenWeather API, and was developed with paid access. 
With that in mind, the developer collection from openweathermaps.org is required for the function of this application.
This collection is available free for 6 months to students.

The application displays current temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius along with a description of the weather, 
accompanied by the appropriate icon to represent current conditions. Alongside this information is the date and time, as well as wind speed and humidity percentage.
Available with a paid API key are high and low temps, as well as a drop-down menu allowing the user to review the weather up to a week into the future. The GUI automatically darkens after sunset, a time determined from API data as well.
